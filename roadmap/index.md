## Foreword

In an effort to be transparent with our roadmap, we are publishing in advance the important changes that are in progress. As we are a small team and not all dependencies are in our control, release dates may change in some circumstances but we will do our best to communicate them as soon as possible. This roadmap intends to show future changes that may affect existing applications and also includes the new features we are currently working on.
