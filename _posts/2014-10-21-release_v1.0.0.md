## HA Cluster

The master/slave architecture of the cluster allows it to scale horizontally by introducing more workers and also ensures availability. We call the master 'Coordinator' and the slave nodes 'Workers'.

### Coordinator

* Load balances /extract requests;
* Load balances dictionary updates;
* Manages update feeds;
* Manages worker dictionary queries.

### Worker
* Keeps track of its dictionaries fingerprint;
* Creates a pool of pipelines;
* Serves extraction requests;
* Ability to update it's Gazetteer and Metadata PR SPARQL queries;
* Ability to reload the whole pipeline dictionary.

## Dynamic updates

* Multiple retries on failed update, full dictionary reload is triggered after a limit is hit (configurable);
* EUF plug-in keeps track of updated entities and serves changelists through special SPARQL queries;
* Updates are kept track of via GraphDB's fingerprints.
